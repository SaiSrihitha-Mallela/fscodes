Somu is playing a game. The Game Rules are as follows 

A word will be given, where Ramu has to replace the letters of the word with V/C
If the letter is a vowel it will be de denoted by upper case letter ‘V’ and 
if the letter is a consonant it will be denoted by upper case letter ‘C’. 

Note - The output will contain a word containing alternating sequence of ‘C’ and ‘V’.
It is not permissible to have two or more consecutive V or C in Sequence.
Letters will be only(a-z/A-Z)

input = hello 
output = CVCV

Explanation - When we convert the above  "hello" we have CVCCV 
but for the output It is not permissible to have two or more consecutive V or C in Sequence.
so CVCCV changes to CVCV
